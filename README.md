# HTMLDecoder
The code retrieves HTML content from a URL, then uses regular expressions to extract the x-coordinate, character, and y-coordinate from &lt;span> tags within &lt;td> elements in the table rows. It constructs a 2D grid based on the maximum x and y values, populates the grid with the characters at the specified coordinates, and prints the grid row by row.
